# Design principles
* Must have 99.99% cache hit rate
* Cache miss - render time must be under 5ms
* Main document must fit to one jumbo frame (Transit layer could be IPv4 or IPv6)
* Hot swap deployment technology must be used and the target is 1440 deployments per day.

# Future plans
* High Availability - Introduce espoo Datacenter
* Offline experience with service worker
